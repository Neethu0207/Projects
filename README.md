🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Description:
This project helps in finding a person has Heart Disease or not with the help of Machine Learning Techniques.It helps to detect and take early precautions which also helps in saving a life.
Machine learning algorithms can effectively predict heart disease risk by analyzing patient data to identify patterns and predict potential risks.Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives.
📂 Dataset:
I have collected the data from kaggle["https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset"]
Features:
-age
-sex
-cp (chest pain type)
-trestbps (resting blood pressure)
-chol (serum cholesterol)
-fbs (fasting blood sugar)
-restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
-thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
-exang (exercise-induced angina)
-oldpeak, slope, ca, thal
Target: target (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)
